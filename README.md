Opavo
=====

A toy application we built at [Untyped University](http://untyped.com/untyping/2011/09/01/uu-and-you-learn-some-opa/), to learn more about [Opa](http://opalang.com).

Opavo is intended to be a simple version of [Olark](http://olark.com), 
which provides a live chat widget that can be embedded into web sites to provide
help-desk style support.

Although Opavo is far from complete at the moment, building it has helped us learn a bit about
the programming models behind Opa. All bug fixes and new features are welcome!

## Usage

To compile the code, just run `make`. You'll be left with an `opavo.exe` executable. Run the executable and connection to `localhost:8080` for the user chat, and `localhost:8080/admin` for the admin chat.
