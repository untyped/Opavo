Opavo
=====

A toy application we built at Untyped University, to learn more about [Opa](http://opalang.com).

Opavo is intended to be a simple version of [Olark](http://olark.com), 
which provides a live chat widget that can be embedded into web sites to provide
help-desk style support.

Although Opavo is far from complete at the moment, building it has helped us learn a bit about
the programming models behind Opa. All bug fixes and new features are welcome!
